=partial-recall= provides a narrow buffer scope built on top of
=tab-bar-mode=. It turns each tab into a living (that is: forgetful)
workspace. Each meaningful buffer that is first visited in a tab will
be associated with that tab until a limit is met whereupon the oldest
buffer is forgotten. If a newly visited buffer is already associated
with another tab, it may be reclaimed (automatically or manually). If
all buffers were visited relatively recently, the size of the limit
increases (for that tab).

See *Concepts* section below for more information.

** Installation

If you use =straight= or =quelpa=, you know what to do.

If you're on Emacs >29, I recommend using =package-vc-install=.

Alternatively, provided you have Cask, you can install the package
with =make package-install= after initializing the submodule =dinghy=.

#+begin_src
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Walheimat/partial-recall.git
cd partial-recall/
make package install
#+end_src

** Concepts

*** Memories and moments

The association buffer â†’ tab is done using two structures: memories
and moments.

A memory is a ring of moments and a key used for look-up. The size of
the ring is determined by =partial-recall-memory-size=.

A moment is a buffer, a timestamp at which it was focused, a count of
how many times it was focused and a flag indicating whether it is
permanent (see below on topics *Permanence* and *Concentration*).

Visiting a buffer will schedule its handling which is to say that
handling is delayed by =partial-recall-handle-delay= seconds. So if
you were to quickly switch between buffers, only the one you linger on
eventually would be handled (handling is a no-op if the buffer is no
longer visible at that point).

Handling a buffer will do one of two things:

1. A new moment is created from that buffer by "remembering" it; this
   means storing it in the current tab's memory.
2. An existing moment is "recollected", which in turn means one of two
   things:
   1. If it belongs to another memory, it may be "reclaimed" depending
      on =partial-recall-short-term=.
   2. If it belongs to the current memory, it is "reinforced", that
      is, pushed to the top of the ring again.

Since memories are rings, moments will leave the ring after more
moments than its size will allow have been added without revisiting
them. This removal is called "forgetting". You may also call
=partial-recall-forget= (or =partial-recall-forget-some=) manually (or
kill the buffer). Memories will grow instead of forgetting the oldest
moment if it is still relatively young. This is determined by
=partial-recall-intermediate-term=.

Forgotten buffers are not immediately lost, they are put in a special
memory called the "subconscious" from which they can be "lifted" using
=partial-recall-lift=. The subconscious works like any other memory:
it is a ring of moments and can only hold a limited amount. If
=partial-recall-repress= is =t=, the buffers of moments leaving the
subconscious are killed. Closing a tab means forgetting all of the
associated memory's moments.

You may also push buffers from the current memory to another using
=partial-recall-reject=.

*** Permanence

Moments normally age out of its memory unless their buffers are
re-visited (or focused upon) and refreshed before that would happen.
"Permanent" moments don't suffer this fate. There are three scenarios
by which a moment is made permanent:

1. The user calls =partial-recall-implant= and selects its buffer.
2. The moment has been revisited and re-inserted so often that its
   focus reached =partial-recall-auto-implant=.
3. The moment has been concentrated upon to reach that same threshold.

Different actions affect moments differently. Concentration, explained
below, allots the biggest amount of focus. The values are governed by
=partial-recall-intensities=.

The reverse of implanting is "excising" which =partial-recall-implant=
will do if called with =C-u=. Permanent buffers can still be forgotten
manually.

*** Concentration

Every minute =partial-recall= will "concentrate" on the
=current-buffer=. If the focused buffer doesn't change between cycles
its focus will increase (see *Permanence*) otherwise concentration
is broken and will begin again for the current buffer.

/Note/ that concentration is a no-op if the =current-buffer= is not a
meaningful buffer.

*** Meaningful buffers and buffer traits

=partial-recall= only "remembers" buffers that are "meaningful". This
is governed by a list of predicates listed in
=partial-recall-meaningful-traits=. They all must return =t= to mark a
meaningful buffer. If you set it to ='(always)= all buffers would be
considered meaningful.

By default only three traits are in the list:

1. =buffer-file-name=, meaning any buffer that has a file name is
   meaningful.
2. =partial-recall--not-filtered-p= which means the buffers name is
   not matched by =partial-recall-filter=.
3. =partial-recall--not-in-view-mode= which should be
   self-explanatory.

For these three traits property
=partial-recall-non-meaningful-explainer= is set which is read by
=partial-recall-explain-omission= if you want to know why a particular
buffer was omitted (also present in the help echo of the mode-line
lighter). So if you add your own trait here, consider doing the
following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(put 'my/partial-recall-trait 'partial-recall-non-meaningful-explainer "I have my reasons")
#+end_src

There are also =partial-recall-memorable-traits=. These are functions
called when the user invokes =partial-recall-flush= to clear up the
current memory. The default function checks whether a moment was
either implanted, has gained any focus or is relatively young.

** Configuration

=partial-recall= will turn on =tab-bar-mode= if it isn't already turned
on. =partial-recall-mode= will make sure all newly created frames are
taken into account.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package partial-recall
  :custom

  (partial-recall-buffer-limit 10) ;; The number of buffers in the ring.

  :config

  (with-eval-after-load 'consult

     'partial-recall-x-consult-buffer-source))

  :bind-keymap
  (("C-c b" . partial-recall-command-map)))
#+end_src

I suggest to just bind the command map as shown above, otherwise you
probably want to bind the following commands:

- =partial-recall-forget=
- =partial-recall-implant=
- =partial-recall-lift=
- =partial-recall-menu=
- =partial-recall-reclaim=
- =partial-recall-remember=
- =partial-recall-switch-to-buffer=
- =partial-recall-meld=
- =partial-recall-flush=
- =partial-recall-next=
- =partial-recall-previous=
- =partial-recall-forget-some=
- =partial-recall-explain-omission=
- =partial-recall-reject=
