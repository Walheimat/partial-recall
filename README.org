This package is my personal =tab-bar-mode=-based =consult= buffer source.

=partial-recall= will keep track of a limited number of file buffers in
a ring for the tab they were visited in. Buffers are time-stamped to
(1) allow for the memory to grow if the oldest one is still relatively
new and (2) to allow reclaiming buffers from other tabs if they're
relatively old.

** Installation

If you use =straight= or =quelpa=, you know what to do.

If you're on Emacs >29, I recommend using =package-vc-install=.

Alternatively, provided you have Cask, you can install the package
with =make package-install=.

** Configuration

I mainly wrote this to have a tab-scoped list of buffers.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package partial-recall
  :custom
  (partial-recall-buffer-limit 20) ;; The number of buffers in the ring.
  (partial-recall-max-age 100) ;; The age (in seconds) that will allow the ring to grow.
  (partial-recall-reclaim-min-age 100) ;; The age (in seconds) that will allow reclaiming.

  :config
  (partial-recall-mode)

  (with-eval-after-load 'consult
    (add-to-list
     'consult-buffer-sources
     'partial-recall--consult-buffer-source)))
